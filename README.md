Prediction Depth  and Width of electron beam welding process (with used GradientBoostingRegressor)
input 4 parametrs:
1. Welding current value (IW);
2. Electron beam focusing (IF);
3. Welding speed (VW);
4. Distance from the surface of the samples to the electron-optical system (FP).
Application predict Depth  and Width of electron beam welding process uses GradientBoostingRegressor
